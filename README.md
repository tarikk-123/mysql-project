I have completed a MySQL project with the following steps:

1- Installation of MySQL on Ubuntu.

2 -Configuration of necessary settings for service access in MySQL and connection to the database using DBReaver.

3- Designing a relational database on MySQL and creating tables.

4- Adding data to the tables by reading from CSV files through Python scripts.

5- Executing analytical SQL queries.

I have shared my project on Medium, you can access it through this link:
